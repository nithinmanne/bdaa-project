Project
Naga Nithin Manne


This is the main front end. I actually worked more on this than the ingestion
pipelin, as I have never used Javascript before and wanted to use this
project to get more experience with it. It supports login/register with cookies.

Each page has a separate file inside the pages folder. And all table operations
are done only using the code in the tables folder.


Run Instructions:
node app.js <Port> <HBase Host> <HBase Port> <Kafka Brokers>
